# menu-making-app

My project "MEAZY" stands for menu-easy helps the housewife to get rid of problem of asking #khane-me-kya-banau. So considering this problem I have decided to create something like todolist which can solve this problem.


First of all a user has to login to his account by using signup and login facility.

Then a person can upload dishes which are coming to his mind in UPLOAD DISHES tab this feature helps in lack of instant recalling of menu when ask suddenly of recommending things. Thus the user can upload things which are coming to his mind anytime.

Then there is a tab of CREATECHART where user can create his own favourite chart for the week. It has a facility of deleting and adding menu in his chart. It also displays the list of items stored in upload dishes tab.

Then it has Home page where user get directed and he can see his chart which he has created.
